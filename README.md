# pride-and-injury
A (re)(re)(re)retranslation of Pride and Prejudice, made for #NaNoGenMo 2021

This short script uses Google and Alibaba's translation APIs to translate Jane Austen's *Pride and Prejudice* from English to Chinese, Chinese to Russian, then to Portuguese, and finally back to English. To avoid being cut off from these APIs, it only translates a paragraph at a time, and pauses for 90 seconds between each step.

Key Files:
* pride.py is the script itself
* pride_and_prejudice_complete.txt is the original novel, as it appears on Project Gutenberg
* pride-translated.txt is the new translation

I have plans to format the text file, but that'll have to wait for another day. When I do, it will look something like this:

(Sad trombone: I just may be missing some paragraphs in the middle due to some glitches with the APIs. They'll be here soon!)
